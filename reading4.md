## Why does it matter?
Proper troubleshooting helps resolve issues in IT big or small. Keeping proper documentation helps solve future problems or help the person having the issue fix it in the future in case it appears again. A lot of issues can be time consuming and mentally exhausting but the headache can be avoided with proper steps. 

1. What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
- Break them up into individual problems and go through them and solve them individually.
  
2. What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
- Implement the solution. It can sometimes be done quick depending on the situation. you make the change and everything is fixed and working. On a production system scenario, you might be only be able to fix it on a certain day at a certain time and make a plan in order to fix the issue in that production environment.
  
3. What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
- If the problem ever comes back they'll be able to address it by following instructions. A formal database its recommended that way its searchable, and can always add information to it.

4. Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?

A scenario i came across is when one of my family members decided to change phones and give their's to another person. The biggest issue was the pictures were  saved on google drive and wanted to transfer all the pictures to the new phone. I tried every simple solution but none of if worked. they wanted to buy more space for the drive which would be costly. Eventually i remember transferring all the pictures on a USB in order to free up space on the cloud or just use the cloud for important documents. I troubleshooted the problem and found put several issues:

* There was no space left in the google drive
  
* the person wasn't aware that the pictures were saved on the cloud therefore she can erase the phone for a new user and not loose the pictures.
  
* she was not able to save more pictures or important files due to the drive being full

I was able to explain the issues at hand and recommend that she needed to free up space and to put most of the pictures in a USB drive. I did not, unfortunately wrote down the steps for troubleshooting but i was able to explain and solve the issue.

## Analogy
The article helps understand the proper steps for troubleshooting in the IT world. Its important to break multiple issues separately and focusing on them individually in order to solve the problem. Proper documentation is as well important in case the problem comes back again and the person will be able to fix it. If nothing works staring over and analyzing can help. Once applied the fix you need to test it to make sure you solved the problem and consult with the costumer to see if you fix the issue they were having.
## Things i want to know more about.
- Learning to document as i tried to resolve the issue in order to look at the steps and come back to them when its not working.
- Fixing issues within terminals and commands.
